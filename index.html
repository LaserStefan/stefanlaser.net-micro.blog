			 <p>Awesome audience. This morning at #easst4s2024, I discussed our upcoming book (series) on &ldquo;Predictions&rdquo; (Mattering Press, w/ Mél Hogan and Edward Ongweso Jr).</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re inviting #sts authors to experiment with the format of predictions. A troubling format. But it offers room to imagine and intervene. To show up differently. To learn from sf.</p>
<p>It requires careful editing though, so the comments about where and how to be critical were essential. Attentive folks</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This is a hot take that Lee Vinsel has been trying to drive home for a couple of weeks already. &ldquo;Hot&rdquo;, as in, a lively idea, something he grapples with. I find the idea puzzling and compelling. So here are a few thoughts, experiences, and links to follow.</p>
<p>Describing something as a #technofix has become a staple of critical commentary on technology, and perhaps global capitalism per se. A technofix is not really a fix, rather, it distracts from the actual issues. Mostly, these are social ones. Think all of what Silicon Valley is doing, like AI solving something. It&rsquo;s delusional.</p>
<p>Yet Lee and others ask: Is this really a pressing issue? What exactly are technofixes? It appears like this is a slippery term applied to anything vaguely. Sounds familiar to me. More importantly, however, technofixes might not be the most pressing things to discuss. STS devotes too much attention to problematic technologies. (Perhaps technologies and innovations more generally.)</p>
<p>Check out Lee&rsquo;s recent podcast Peoples &amp; Things where he discusses the matter together with the engineer Guru Madhawhan, who wrote a book on wicked problems.</p>
<p><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/guru-madhavan-on-wicked-problems-and-engineering/id1582768008?i=1000651161204">podcasts.apple.com/us/podcas&hellip;</a></p>
<p>This also relates to the discussion around &ldquo;solutionism,&rdquo; a term that, I agree, remains rather vague yet very strong and often ignores materialities, impasses, and virtualities.</p>
<h1 id="leakage-experience">Leakage Experience</h1>
<p>Moving on to our recent #stsing conference in Dresden. I was taking part in a panel on waste and discards, hosted by a research network that we, as waste scholars, have received funding for. Check the links for info on both the event and the network.</p>
<p><a href="https://sts-leakage.org">sts-leakage.org</a>
<a href="https://waste-in-motion.org">waste-in-motion.org</a></p>
<p>Some presenters and commentators mentioned the notion of a technofix. It is indeed a recurring theme in all things discard. When you encounter marine plastics, there are gigantic projects around ocean cleanup that spread hope and call for a solution. With a lot of funding. Easy rollout of the technofix critique. I&rsquo;ve research electronic waste in detail, and through recycling technologies, the technofix is ever-present. Well, digital devices themselves are technofix devices to a certain degree, promising easier lifes, more efficient work, less paper, less stress, whatnot.</p>
<p>Where to go from here? First, I was reminded of the critical discussion around this critique (a criti-hype).</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/tag/criti-hype/">pluralistic.net/tag/criti&hellip;</a></p>
<p>(Citing Cory although this is also a term introduced by Lee)</p>
<p><a href="https://sts-news.medium.com/youre-doing-it-wrong-notes-on-criticism-and-technology-hype-18b08b4307e5">sts-news.medium.com/youre-doi&hellip;</a></p>
<p>Technofixes might not be that big of a problem, empirically speaking. Thus, this analytic would have outlived itself. It might be us scholars bathing in our on conceptual pool. Still, we had a fruitful conversation in Dresden around this very notion. The critique of the critique was resonating, but staying with the technofix as a genuine problem remained of high value.</p>
<p>Excessive systems of industrialism, capitalism and colonialism turn to seemingly novel technologies to turn the tides and stay focused on growth, no matter what. This is hot the oil industries turn to plastic materials in times of crises.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90771524/untangling-the-corporate-lies-about-plastic">www.fastcompany.com/90771524/&hellip;</a></p>
<p>In Dresden, we also had the pleasure of enjoying Nerea Calvillo&rsquo;s keynote on air pollution. Nerea argued that technologies of remedy are part of the problem of containing air pollution. Well, even the notion of &ldquo;containment&rdquo; is problematic, because no container holds tight. What has to be done instead is tackle the upstream pollution; to cut off the gas, and oil, and move away from coal. To stop the pollution instead of adapting to it.</p>
<p>As a daily user of air purification technologies and face masks (#Vietnam, #Hanoi), I was puzzled. Is there no value in maintenance, care, even for moments, even if this is not helpful in a systematic sense &ndash; because it saves lives, here and now. But Nerea doubled down and made this into an argument of against repair.</p>
<p>I am not sure whether I like this twist, turning against maintenance and repair, even if only for strategic reasons. Narea has published on the troubles of living in a permanently polluted world, so this is not really an argument against care and its conceptual siblings, I suppose.</p>
<p><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0306312718783087">journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.11&hellip;</a>
<a href="https://www.arch.columbia.edu/books/catalog/1035-aeropolis-queering-air-in-toxicpolluted-worlds">www.arch.columbia.edu/books/cat&hellip;</a></p>
<p>Max Liboiron offers a related argument, although with a different focus. Similarly vast in consequences, perhaps. Think threshold limits and pollution. The dose is the problem; you know the deal. Sounds reasonable. Keep pollution below the limits.</p>
<p>But because of the very invention of threshold values, pollution is here to stay. Because of the fixation on threshold values, it is here to say. Threshold values pushed Ulrich Beck into mad mode in his Risk Society book, a paragraph that is hardly cited. And Max writes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of changing systems that allowed industrial effluents to begin with, governance could turn to technical efforts to locate and manage allowable limits. This is the foundation of [what Max calls] the permission-to-pollute system.&quot; (p. 51 in Pollution is Colonialism)</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="the-infrastructure-fix">The Infrastructure Fix</h1>
<p>Instead of juggling with technofixes, it is worth exploring &ldquo;infrastructural fixes&rdquo;. When systems set up and embrace infrastructures that make sociotechnical change an impossible task, then the infrastructure fixes people, things, and lives. Investing in the brutal nature of these infrastructures becomes deeply problematic. Slow violence is bound to happen. This is demonstrated well in energy thinking, say, when the After Oil collective posits:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Then there are the enduring powers of infrastructure: pipelines, refineries, highways that push us to replicate behaviours and cultural forms. It is difficult, perhaps impossible, for the social majority to imagine and embrace a society that is not dependent on carbon energy.&rdquo; (After Oil 2015: 39)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://afteroil.ca/publications/">afteroil.ca/publicati&hellip;</a></p>
<p>So, when you and I and the affected communities just cannot move away from daily struggles, deadly troubles, then it&rsquo;s worth rolling out a &ldquo;fix&rdquo; critique. A critique that turns to infrastructural harm.</p>
<p>It sounds like a good idea to stop using notions when you hardly know what they are about anymore. Sure, uttering &ldquo;technofix&rdquo; might get people engaged and find an initial common ground. But it&rsquo;s trajectory is puzzling. So, here&rsquo;s the infrastructure fix as a rough sketch.</p>
<p><em>The snapshot attached is from the Leakage conference, with a zoom on materials dug up in a panel on coal landscapes and imaginaries. Imaginge fixing that mix of contaminated and probably clean matter.</em></p>

			 <p>You have probably come across this post, but in case you have not, get ready for a thorough analysis that is not only for pollution or tech nerds. (But it&rsquo;s certainly ALSO for those people.)</p>
<p>In &ldquo;How Google is killing independent sites like ours&rdquo;, the independent website HouseFresh goes into the details to show why Google Search has deteriorated &ndash; has become shit, as Cory Doctorow puts it.</p>
<p><a href="https://housefresh.com/david-vs-digital-goliaths/">housefresh.com/david-vs-&hellip;</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Savvy SEOs at big media publishers (or third-party vendors hired by them) realised that they could create pages for ‘best of’ product recommendations without the need to invest any time or effort in actually testing and reviewing the products first.
So, they peppered their pages with references to a ‘rigorous testing process,’ their ‘lab team,’ subject matter experts ‘they collaborated with,’ and complicated methodologies that seem impressive at a cursory look.
Sometimes, they even added photos of ‘tests’ with products covered in Post-it notes, someone holding a tape measure, and people with very ‘scientific’ clipboards.
There’s nothing wrong with wanting to show you’re doing the thing you’re supposed to be doing, <strong>but what happens when that’s as far as you go?</strong>
All they had to do was say what they needed to say to pass a manual check if it came to that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a particular case, air purifiers, but everyone knows these weird websites HouseFresh is talking about. At least when you&rsquo;re using the internet to order things. Which is virtually everyone since at least Covid.</p>
<h1 id="what-to-do-with-air-pollution-data">What to do with air pollution data?</h1>
<p>I study waste for 10 years, and thinking about air pollution is part of this project. This has also to do with my studies in India back in 2012, when I was (severely) sick from the air pollution. I also almost ran an air pollution research project, but the grant competition was too high. Anyway, since then I have been eager to follow public discussions around air pollution and how the public is engaged.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a new piece by the brilliant <em>Rest of the World</em> magazine that puts a focus on South Asia. Like many features on waste and pollution, it takes a research stance and introduces ✨data✨. It&rsquo;s great. But what&rsquo;s the point if the data is boring because it&rsquo;s so obvious?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Riders in the Smog&rdquo; is the title of this piece, and in this the authors equipped gig workers with pollution monitors. It&rsquo;s a fairly specific consumer brand (Atmotube Pro) with proprietary data interpretations, yet it gets the job done. &ldquo;The readings were off the charts.&rdquo; Sort of. Or, as it&rsquo;s described in a scene.</p>
<p><a href="https://restofworld.org/2024/riders-in-the-smog-gig-workers-pollution/">restofworld.org/2024/ride&hellip;</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alongside tracking specific pollutants, the Atmotube Pro gives an overall real-time air quality score (AQS) from 0–100, with zero being the most severely polluted, and 100 being the cleanest. According to Atmo, the company that makes the Atmotube monitors, a reading of 0–20 should be considered a health alert, under which conditions “everyone should avoid all outdoor exertion.” But the three gig workers found their monitors consistently displayed the lowest possible score.
As Iqbal went about his work picking up and dropping off customers, his pollution monitor barely budged from a score of zero. “Is this device even working?” he asked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You cannot divide by 0. There is no fragment of healthy air in everyday life in Lahore, New Delhi, and Dhaka. It&rsquo;s slightly better indoors. But that does not translate to healthy. It just moves from &ldquo;hazardous&rdquo; to &ldquo;very unhealthy&rdquo;. (This is something that is only told by the genius categories introduced by the Air Quality Index. It made the grade choice of not setting an upper limit, so that the PM1s, 2s, 10s and VOCs can keep on rising and we may through a daunting colour and name at it.</p>
<p>There is also a methodology article on this:
<a href="https://restofworld.org/2024/riders-in-the-smog-air-quality-methodology/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feeds">https://restofworld.org/2024/riders-in-the-smog-air-quality-methodology/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feeds</a></p>
<p>While the data is not particularly useful, I enjoyed how the authors talked to medical staff and their recent experiences. This is how to add quality and concrete experiences. Recently, I have become to know the troubling perspective through Hanoi people: It&rsquo;s bad but I still do relatively fine. A bit of coughing, it will be gone. But there are many stories of people, and tough <em>Schicksalsschläge</em>, that are worth reporting.</p>
<h1 id="podcast-of-the-week">Podcast of the week</h1>
<p>I like to include podcast in this, one podcast if possible. Yet it had to be two this week. Mél and Anne had their (often shared) discussion on how to make sense of (data centre) efficiency (data), and the politics of engagement. Go Data Fix!</p>
<p><a href="https://shows.acast.com/the-data-fix/episodes/efficient-with-anne-pasek">shows.acast.com/the-data-&hellip;</a></p>
<p>And then there is fellow German waste scholar (LMU Munich and Uni Augsburg, now Heisenberg Professor in Oxford) Simone Müller who was on the Edge Effects show. Dial in for a wild ride on waste colonialism.</p>
<p><a href="https://edgeeffects.net/simone-muller/">edgeeffects.net/simone-mu&hellip;</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I feel environmental justice has done a lot of work to go the civil rights route. We see scholars and a lot of national activists coming to think about civil rights—what that means for non-discriminatory disposal of hazardous waste or also the situated mass of dirty industries in particular communities. But interestingly, they have done little oftentimes to pivot to the notion of other universal rights—universal civil rights versus something like that could almost be framed as “separate but equal” on a global scale.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I found this podcast because someone recommended it on Mastodon. A Segway. Swoosh.</p>

<p>Vice apparently shuts down, because of odd management. Platform decay, see above.</p>

<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/24/anti-posse/">pluralistic.net/2024/02/2&hellip;</a></p>
<p>Also consider how Reddit is doing the next step of selling its user/data base.</p>

<p><a href="https://tante.cc/2024/02/27/the-automattic-ai-thing/">tante.cc/2024/02/2&hellip;</a></p>
<p>This website POSSE here and independent networks like the Fediverse are one way to tackle the issue. But this new thinking can go in different directions. A few examples I compiled this week are the following.</p>
<p>Remember your first website from the 1990s or early 2000s? Ashamed/proud of the looks? I only now realized that there are extensive networks of websites that help you create these wonderful pages again. Neocities is the most prominent one.</p>
<p><a href="https://neocities.org/">neocities.org</a></p>
<p>(Also remember the past when annoyed users created a People Against Under Construction Images manifesto that is still life today. Rehearse!)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.andrews.edu/~rickyr/noconst.html">www.andrews.edu/~rickyr/n&hellip;</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Under Construction images are never seen at highly popular and constantly changing web sites such as Netscape CNN, Yahoo!, or Lycos. If the best don&rsquo;t do it, neither should the worst. Under Construction Images should be removed from the layout of all Web pages. Take yours off now!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok, boomer.</p>
<p>Lastly, embrace this: Towards a quieter, friendlier web:</p>
<p><a href="https://coryd.dev/posts/2024/towards-a-quieter-friendlier-web/">coryd.dev/posts/202&hellip;</a></p>
<p>With gems such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Share what you enjoy or what you&rsquo;re curious about. Not everyone will enjoy of it, some people will appreciate different things, but build friendships on mutual interests. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to say you don&rsquo;t know something. Being forthright and asking for help is an admirable quality.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="wrap-up">Wrap up</h1>
<p>I try to do these dumps regularly now. A brief holiday was in between this and the more recent post. Let me know what you think in the comments and leave a kudos.</p>
<p>One more thing. The snapshots I include are Fuji pictures from the region. I think this period of AI hype that also tries to get rid of the creative arts is a perfect time to embrace photography, and more.</p>

			 <p>Starting off with an odd one: Big Oil apparently funded climate science since the early 1950s. And it was Keeling himself at the centre. Think Keeling curves and long-term CO2 measurements. But it sounds like a different time. Less evil still, so that Keeling could use this funding for the good. Part of this story is that differences between air pollution and CO2 emissions were much less clear.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.desmog.com/2024/01/30/fossil-fuel-industry-sponsored-climate-science-1954-keeling-api-wspa/">www.desmog.com/2024/01/3&hellip;</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Newly discovered documents affirm that the automobile and petroleum industries funded early climate science Keeling conducted at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) between 1954 and 1956. Records show that &ldquo;oil and auto companies&rdquo; sponsored the scientist&rsquo;s research via an organization called the Southern California Air Pollution Foundation, formed in 1953 to tackle Los Angeles&rsquo;s infamous smog. American Motors, Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors were among 18 automotive companies that gave money to the foundation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fast forward to the future of the present. Here is a sweet summary of climate disasters and tipping points on different levels:</p>

<h1 id="podcast-of-the-week">Podcast of the week</h1>
<p>I happen to share one podcast per week, and here is an episode of Drilled that you surely should not miss, featuring a &ldquo;messy conversation&rdquo; on the climate movement w/ Rhiana Gunn-Wright. Slightly tilted towards the American culture war, but quickly turning global. It also fits to the link mentioned before. Why are companies sending powerful signals to care for <em>global</em> emissions, but ignore to take into consideration affected communities next door?</p>
<p><a href="https://drilled.media/podcasts/drilled/10/messyconversations-rhiana">drilled.media/podcasts/&hellip;</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rhiana Gunn-Wright was one of the architects of the Green New Deal, and today works as the climate policy director for the Roosevelt Institute. In this episode we get into the nuances of the IRA, how to handle climate being a &ldquo;culture war&rdquo; issue, what&rsquo;s going on with anti-renewables, and what the climate movement loses when it turns its back on justice issues and particularly when it turns its back on the Black community.</p>

<h1 id="the-new-web-of-scams">The new web of scams</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ve recently framed the turn toward non-commercial web applications as a turn toward the lovely new web. Let&rsquo;s not forget that it&rsquo;s full of scams, too.</p>
<p>A phenomenal example is propaganda in India made by and for Modi.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/03/world/asia/india-modi-ayodhya-media.html">www.nytimes.com/2024/02/0&hellip;</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In moments of political tension, stars with huge followings put out nearly copy-and-paste messages of support. And as the election nears, cabinet ministers have turned to podcasts and online broadcasts with influencers to reach a generation that gets its information outside the traditional channels that Mr. Modi has co-opted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cory Doctorow covers the more individual side of scams. Scams, basically. Reaching out when you&rsquo;re most vulnerable.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/05/cyber-dunning-kruger/">pluralistic.net/2024/02/0&hellip;</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I find the inner workings of scams to be fascinating, and it&rsquo;s also important to remind people that everyone is vulnerable sometimes, and scammers are willing to try endless variations until an attack lands at just the right place, at just the right time, in just the right way. If you think you can&rsquo;t get scammed, that makes you especially vulnerable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cory nailed it once again with another post this day, calling out Apple for its corruption, and blatantly misreading EU regulation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s a strain of anti-anti-monopolist that insists that they&rsquo;re not pro-monopoly – they&rsquo;re just realists who understand that global gigacorporations are too big to fail, too big to jail, and that governments can&rsquo;t hope to rein them in. Trying to regulate a tech giant, they say, is like trying to regulate the weather.
This ploy is cousins with Jay Rosen&rsquo;s idea of &ldquo;savvying,&rdquo; defined as: &ldquo;dismissing valid questions with the insider&rsquo;s, &lsquo;and this surprises you?&rsquo;&rdquo;
The reason this foolish nonsense flies is that we are living in an age of rampant corruption and utter impunity. Companies really do get away with both literal and figurative murder. Governments really do ignore horrible crimes by the rich and powerful, and fumble what rare, few enforcement efforts they assay.
And then we get the details.</p>

<p>Lunar new year is like Christmas and New Year packed into one (maybe more on top), basically shutting down the urban centres. This is also the reason I will keep a low profile for a week. Cheers.</p>

			 <p>&ldquo;Where have all the websites gone?&rdquo; is the question posed by blogger Jason. And he sends us a link with a marvellous list. Let&rsquo;s go down this path.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s a technical marvel, that internet. Something so mindblowingly impressive that if you showed it to someone even thirty years ago, their face would melt the fuck off. So why does it feel like something’s missing? Why are we all so collectively unhappy with the state of the web?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.fromjason.xyz/p/notebook/where-have-all-the-websites-gone/">www.fromjason.xyz/p/noteboo&hellip;</a></p>
<p>Take the Grumpy Website:</p>
<p><a href="https://grumpy.website/">grumpy.website</a></p>
<p>Or the manifest for a cheap internet. Sweet.</p>
<p><a href="https://potato.cheap/">potato.cheap</a></p>
<p>So, work on your own website and be sceptical of the containers of modern social media (or whatever, do what you want with the web, it&rsquo;s just in another exciting new phase). The topic has been nicely summarised here:</p>
<p><a href="https://danluu.com/why-video/">danluu.com/why-video&hellip;</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve started exploring RSS feeds in creative ways, which is also how I came across the &ldquo;where have all the websites gone&rdquo; topic via No Tech Magazine. Not only is there the interesting (if sometimes flawed) Low Tech Magazine, but there&rsquo;s also No Tech Magazine, yes. Check out the recent post about various interesting meta links,</p>
<p><a href="https://www.notechmagazine.com/2024/01/no-tech-reader-43.html">www.notechmagazine.com/2024/01/n&hellip;</a></p>
<p>As a science and technology scholar who studies digital infrastructures and ecology (and happens to be in love with photography), this post is well worth reading, too:</p>
<p>The History and environmental impact of digital image formats [By Unthinking Photography].</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the ecological footprint of photography shifted from film rolls and developing chemicals to digital storage, network transfer and processing power, I see only three ways to reduce our footprint: making fewer pictures, reducing their quality, or using better image formats. Which of these options do you prefer?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is actually the value of photography in research, how does it come about, how can (must!) it be done differently? This is something I&rsquo;ve only thought about superficially in the past (and websites have piqued my interest in kbs and the carbon footprint of megabytes). However, I have a feeling that there is still a lot of discussion to be had here.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Moving on. We&rsquo;re still deep in the fog here in Vietnam. But it&rsquo;s an exciting time. I&rsquo;ve been working on a commentary  about the ongoing chip rush, and every week there&rsquo;s new material in the form of hot news. (On a side-note: my commentary has just been desk-rejected by the first journal I submitted it to. But it has been such a nice comment that helps me put out the text somewhere else, or expand on it in a longer piece. Cultivate friendly terms of rejection, and academia becomes a happier place!).</p>
<p>Vietnam speaks money: German chipmakers want to take part. And American investors have raised billions (!) of dollars. With a big if: Eight billion if the local government invests in renewable energy, which it finds difficult &ndash; and will not tackle to quickly because of a) fear of too risky investments leading to accusations of corruption and landing in a local jail or worse (yes, that&rsquo;s exactly what happens in the context of wind and solar certificates very recently), b) the strong coal lobby and c) the enormous task of maintaining and expanding infrastructure. The past wars have destroyed a lot which still hinders development. Nevertheless, the Vietnamese government is sending strong signals, just this week in Davos.</p>
<p><a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/Europe-s-top-chipmaker-Infineon-ramps-up-hiring-in-India-and-Vietnam2">asia.nikkei.com/Business/&hellip;</a>
<a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Supply-Chain/Vietnam-is-a-top-target-for-CHIPS-Act-aid-funds-U.S.-says">asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight&hellip;</a>
<a href="https://vietnamweekly.substack.com/p/striving-for-semiconductors">vietnamweekly.substack.com/p/strivin&hellip;</a></p>
<p>To cite Mike from his Substack:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Prime minister] Chính guaranteed government support for investors in these fields while noting that the government views semiconductors as a driving force for development, with VnExpress quoting him as saying:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“To develop these fields, Vietnam will promote three strategic breakthroughs: strategic infrastructure, training high-quality human resources and perfecting institutions.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once again: This topic should always be covered with a hint towards a struggling civil society. Here is one.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thevietnamese.org/2024/01/land-activist-and-family-arrive-in-the-u-s-following-exchange-deal-between-hanoi-and-washington/">www.thevietnamese.org/2024/01/l&hellip;</a></p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>I not only try to take stock of high-tech chip developments in Vietnam, but curious developments in other sectors concerning socio-ecological transitions more broadly. Two links were just remarkable during the past week.</p>
<p>One, look at this feature on parcels stolenfrom train carriages in the US. It&rsquo;s a wild ride with lovely (friendly gangster-type) characters.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/magazine/train-robbery-amazon-packages.html?smid=nytcore-android-share">www.nytimes.com/2024/01/2&hellip;</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of all the dozens of suspected thieves questioned by the detectives of the Train Burglary Task Force at the Los Angeles Police Department during the months they spent investigating the rise in theft from the city’s freight trains, one man stood out. What made Victor Llamas memorable wasn’t his criminality so much as his giddy enthusiasm for trespassing. He was a self-taught expert of the supply chain, a connoisseur of shipping containers. Even in custody, as the detectives interrogated him numerous times, after multiple arrests, in a windowless police-station room in the spring of 2022, a kind of nostalgia would sweep over the man. “He said that was the best feeling he’d ever had, jumping on the train while it was moving,” Joe Chavez, who supervised the task force’s detectives, told me. “It was euphoric for him.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Second, and not so funny, the transition to low-carbon energy grids is being thwarted by finance capitalism. That&rsquo;s a bit of a non-surprise. Still, the details of the new scams are (sorry for the uncreative repetition) wild.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/27/here-comes-the-sun-king/">pluralistic.net/2024/01/2&hellip;</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The government created subsidies – tax credits, direct cash, and mixes thereof – in the expectation that Wall Street would see all these credits and subsidies that everyday people were entitled to and go on the hunt for them. And they did! Armies of fast-talking sales-reps fanned out across America, ringing dooorbells and sticking fliers in mailboxes, and lying like hell about how your new solar roof was gonna work out for you.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>These hustlers tricked old and vulnerable people into signing up for arrangements that saw them saddled with ballooning debt payments (after a honeymoon period at a super-low teaser rate), backstopped by liens on their houses, which meant that missing a payment could mean losing your home.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To finish with multimedia: watch this episode about &ldquo;The KGB, The Computer and Me - The Cuckoo’s Egg Story&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>Picture me as A Person Who Stares At Infrastructures, focusing on anything to do with repair, a lot of tech, low-carbon experiments, and a bias towards Asia-Pacific.</p>
<p>#linkdump #vietnam #taiwan #Asia #tech #sts</p>
<p>👇🏼</p>
<p>Let me know what you think of such a dump.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sitting in front of a screen in the capital of Vietnam, and we&rsquo;ve seen some curious trouble recently. We, meaning: the caste of expats. There have been rumours of the most important man, the general secretary of the CPV, being sick. Perhaps deceased.</p>
<p>And then he turned up in a parliamentary session.
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-15/vietnam-s-top-leader-appears-in-public-after-hospitalization?ref=thevietnamese.org">www.bloomberg.com/news/arti&hellip;</a></p>
<p>What strikes me is how some men were quite sure and eager to discuss the matter. Being ahead of things. You found this mostly on former Twitter, of course, a place that cherishes public decay.</p>
<p>There is another hot topic during the Winter months. Air pollution not only keeps expats busy and wondering how to do things differently. Still, it&rsquo;s the expats (like me) who set up sensors and think about this very often. Some of them move.</p>
<p><a href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/environment/air-pollution-sends-hanoi-expats-to-hcmc-4700899.html">e.vnexpress.net/news/news&hellip;</a></p>
<p><a href="https://vietnamweekly.substack.com/p/the-air-pollution-struggle">vietnamweekly.substack.com/p/the-air&hellip;</a></p>
<p>This reminds me of a fierce discussion in Delhi a few years back. Journalists openly called for others to leave. There is a colonial touch in this cleanliness fetish, which just recently has been captured beautifully in a podcast episode of Radio Web MACBA that I highly recommend. It emphasizes how infrastructures are political, and entangled with historical burden, in multiple ways.</p>
<p><a href="https://rwm.macba.cat/en/sonia/sonia-389-francoise-verges">rwm.macba.cat/en/sonia/&hellip;</a></p>
<p>•</p>
<p>Cory Doctorow has been very busy explaining how monopolies are at the heart of tech companies, which is problematic for most humans except the billionaires attached to it.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/17/monopolies-produce-billionaires/">pluralistic.net/2024/01/1&hellip;</a></p>
<p>Such a system produces engines that cannot tame SEO bullshit.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.404media.co/google-search-really-has-gotten-worse-researchers-find/">www.404media.co/google-se&hellip;</a></p>
<p>And corporate blogging platforms that should not exist in the first place.</p>
<p><a href="https://badnewsletter.substack.com/p/all-the-garbage-i-found-on-substack/comments">badnewsletter.substack.com/p/all-the&hellip;</a></p>
<p>But there are interesting, almost surprising developments on other tech fronts. Notably, the right to repair. On the one hand, sure:</p>
<p>Apple embraced the movement half-heartedly a while ago, but in reality, it is still going for software-based locking of its system and pushing its robot-driven recycling, aka shredding system. Alison and I have written about this a while ago.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ephemerajournal.org/contribution/thinking-apple%E2%80%99s-recycling-robots-toward-activation-responsibility-postenvironmentalist">www.ephemerajournal.org/contribut&hellip;</a></p>
<p>It is also worth noting that Apple keeps on drifting away from its security features, not only with its messenger integration wars but also when it comes to AirDrop exploits that harm Chinese citizens (and China proudly shared its strategy of exploiting Apple devices),</p>
<p><a href="https://restofworld.org/2024/exporter-apple-airdrop-security-china/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feeds">https://restofworld.org/2024/exporter-apple-airdrop-security-china/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feeds</a></p>
<p>Yet on the other hand, there&rsquo;s Google, this week entirely going down the right-to-repair road. Let&rsquo;s see how this plays out.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.404media.co/google-formally-endorses-right-to-repair-will-lobby-to-pass-strong-repair-laws/">www.404media.co/google-fo&hellip;</a></p>
<p>It may have to do with a new regulatory environment wary of monopolies.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesling.org/the-ftc-just-blocked-four-mergers-in-a-month-heres-how-its-latest-win-fits-into-the-broader-campaign-to-revive-antitrust/">www.thesling.org/the-ftc-j&hellip;</a></p>
<p>•</p>
<p>In other news, the Taiwan democracy had a little ballot thingy. China is not happy, but neither is the youth. This is of major regional and global relevance&gt;</p>
<p>China apparently tries new economic strategies to exert power, yet its force is limited. So far.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/taiwan-china-economy-01172024233252.html">www.rfa.org/english/n&hellip;</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Taiwan&rsquo;s semiconductor powerhouse, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, aka TSMC, oscillates between bad closing and awesome prediction numbers. Taking part in these evaluations is wild and perfect for analysts to play with.</p>
<p><a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/TSMC-fourth-quarter-profit-drops-19-as-demand-remains-sluggish">asia.nikkei.com/Business/&hellip;</a></p>
<p><a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/TSMC-predicts-revenues-could-grow-26-this-year-on-AI-boom">asia.nikkei.com/Business/&hellip;</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/taiwan-election-relief-world-markets-concern-local-investors-2024-01-14/">www.reuters.com/markets/a&hellip;</a></p>
<p>I am currently working on an academic comment bringing together insights from semiconductor industry events in Asia-Pacific, and I make the case that the realities on the ground need to be acknowledged and brought together with how we envision digital things to work. This is how I think of staring at infrastructures.</p>
<p>Let me close with a little gem I found this week. A little dated it may be, but very helpful for building low-carbon digital tools. Websites, really. try keeping the main load below 14kb. It comes at multiple benefits and makes users happy. As nicely visualised by this post:</p>
<p><a href="https://angusjf.com/14kb/">angusjf.com/14kb/</a></p>
<p>So much for the link dump, a new experiment in my note-taking.</p>

			 <p>Disturbing news. #Vietnam fires 21-gun salute to welcome the Indonesian President, but more salutes of other kinds may follow. The most important man in the country, General Secretary Nguyễn Phú Trọng, is not doing well. He might have surpassed that state 13 hours ago.</p>
<p>Twitter speculates. Wikipedia declared him deceased a few hours ago, only to reverse the status.</p>
<p>Phú Trọng has changed the country drastically in the past 10 years. Let&rsquo;s see what happens and who&rsquo;s rising.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Here&rsquo;s a blog post on #hosting a microblogging instance on the #Fediverse with ecological concerns in mind. It&rsquo;s a longer one. And unfinished, since it&rsquo;s messy tinkering in progress, not least due to my #Vietnam routing. 👇</p>
<p>Following <a href="https://www.easst.net/article/the-environmental-footprint-of-social-media-hosting-tinkering-with-mastodon/">our Mastodon article</a>, I am exploring options to host a Fediverse instance with a Raspberry Pi and solar power, testing limits. The goal is to host one or multiple bots and report on data. Users later. Perhaps this could also be an offer for others to host bots. On another level, this is an effort to compare different fediverse setups and their Ease of use, efficiency, and waste. Other users have already created helpful reports that I can built on, see e.g. <a href="https://it-notes.dragas.net/2023/01/15/deploying-a-piece-of-the-fediverse/">Deploying a piece of the Fediverse (dragas.net)</a></p>
<p>It boils down to choosing the software. As a start, I have asked people on Mastodon and Lemmy for tips on what software to use.</p>
<h1 id="moving-beyond-mastodon-the-heavy-elephant">Moving beyond Mastodon: The heavy elephant</h1>
<p>Users reported Mastodon is resource-heavy, and media caching is an issue, because it caches all media by default without any options to delete. It is not a light system; quite the contrary. Admins, it seems, need experience to manage the potential overload, regardless of their instance&rsquo;s size. At the same time, it lacks features like rich Markdown and Quote Tweets. Install seems to work, but many users report it took multiple hours.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I never used Mastodon because my servers would never handle it. I started with Friendica, moved to pleroma, and ended up ultimately with rebased (and obviously lemmy and lotide and peertube)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a follow-up, that user reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My first server had an outdated CPU, very little memory and a spinning hard drive, so that turned out to be a huge limitation for a lot of software. I needed stuff that hardly used any memory and also didn&rsquo;t have a lot of extra services running at once. When I started adding some services, lots of stuff started grinding to a halt.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>On linux, the glances application is really useful. Besides just showing you what programs are using memory and CPU time, it also shows IOWait times and throughput so if you&rsquo;re being bottlenecked by something or other it&rsquo;s a lot easier to see.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a service called tuned that does some automatic tuning, and if you&rsquo;re using postgres databases, there&rsquo;s another tool called pg_repack that&rsquo;ll pack your database while running. It maxes out your CPU and uses a lot of disk while running, but if you don&rsquo;t do something routinely then your postgresql database slowly gets sloppier and it&rsquo;ll start using more and more resources until your server appears to be useless.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Misskey or Calckey (now: FireFish) are slightly lighter options and much feature richer, but too heavy for a single instance. This is more of a personal project.</p>
<p>Three options appear appropriate. Two of them were suggested in my original online post:</p>
<h1 id="original-post-on-mastodon-and-lemmy-asking-for-help">Original post on Mastodon and Lemmy asking for help</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking for a customisable, resource-efficient Mastodon fork. Bonfire? Rebased? Or go non-Ruby, like Pleroma (nah), Misskey Calckey, indeed, Lemmy (hui)? Any experiences?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is part of an endeavour to host w/ a RaspberryPi &amp; solar power. It will be a device to mess around, test, and share experiences.</p>
<p>Potential features:</p>
<ul>
<li>tweaking network traffic in various ways</li>
<li>media options: off, auto compression, auto delete</li>
<li>monitoring server metrics, energy flow, sharing data through a bot</li>
<li>auto-off when battery low, sad emoji</li>
</ul>
<p>I am re-posting this from Mastodon w/ minor edits because of the Fediverse and potential cross-interaction. I probably should have posted here first and then shared the link on Mastodon, but it&rsquo;s a Mastodon question, so I did it the other way around. Still not sure what&rsquo;s the best way to do this, though.</p>
<h1 id="preface-static-ip-on-the-pi">Preface: static IP on the Pi</h1>
<p>The Pi needs a static IP. Since the machine will be close to the solar battery system, I need a wifi option, as described here:
<a href="https://raspberrypi-guide.github.io/networking/set-up-static-ip-address">Set up a static IP-address | The Raspberry Pi Guide (raspberrypi-guide.github.io)</a></p>
<p>And, to make it open to the web:
Open up your router&rsquo;s admin page and find a section titled either <strong>Port Forwarding</strong>, <strong>Port Mapping</strong>, or <strong>Port Management</strong>, then create two new entries.</p>
<p>The first is for <strong>HTTP</strong> (insecure) traffic. Set both the local and public port to <strong>80</strong>, and the local IP address to the IP address of your Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>The second is for <strong>HTTPS</strong> (secure) traffic. Set both the local and public port to <strong>443</strong>, while keeping the local IP address to the IP address of your Raspberry Pi.</p>
<h1 id="potential-platforms">Potential platforms</h1>
<h2 id="gotosocial">GoToSocial</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>it&rsquo;s still in alpha, but if it&rsquo;s just for messing around maybe try <a href="https://gotosocial.org/">GoToSocial</a>!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I think you&rsquo;d have a much better time with something lighter than Mastodon if it&rsquo;s running on a limited system. If you are really looking to minimise requirements, Pleroma and its derivatives are unfortunately about the best for it afaik, though I certainly have plenty of misgivings. I&rsquo;m personally partial to GoToSocial, and it&rsquo;d be my go-to recommendation for any self-host atm unless they had specific requirements that made it unsuitable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>GoToSocial is the most-like Mastodon option, seeking connections with many Mastodon frontend apps, although with different features and a lighter backend. Crucially, it is built using Golang, a speedy language. This is how they pitch their project: &ldquo;GoToSocial provides a lightweight, customisable, and safety-focused entryway into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">Fediverse</a>, and is comparable to (but distinct from) existing projects such as <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://pleroma.social/">Pleroma</a>, <a href="https://friendica.net/">Friendica</a>, and <a href="https://pixelfed.org/">PixelFed</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The docs offer a docker image, and it seems doable. <a href="https://docs.gotosocial.org/en/latest/getting_started/installation/container/">Container - GoToSocial Documentation</a></p>
<h2 id="akkoma">Akkoma</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I quite like the Akkoma fork of Pleroma.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pleroma has a few development lags and seems to host many right-wing servers (similar to the fork Rebased), so the Akkoma fork is highly welcome. It also has more features. This is why, as one dev emphasises, Akkoma is recommended by key members of the AcitivityPub working group.</p>
<p>These are the docs. <a href="https://akkoma.dev/AkkomaGang/akkoma/">AkkomaGang/akkoma: Magically expressive social media - akkoma - Akkoma Development</a></p>
<p>But, magically, there is an explanation on how to install this on a Pi. <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/raspberry-pi-deploy-akkoma-fediverse-server/">www.makeuseof.com/raspberry&hellip;</a></p>
<h2 id="honk">Honk</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>If you only want a single-user instance you can go with <a href="https://humungus.tedunangst.com/r/honk">honk</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Right now I host it on my rpi3 under a vlan connection (1000kbps/125kbps). No struggle, 120mb in ram for an uptime of 80 days. Following nearly 40 accounts on 15 instances.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>honk sounds like a joke, and it is funny to a certain degree. As explained in their docs, it is a ridiculously simple setup: &ldquo;Take control of your honks and join the federation. An ActivityPub server with minimal setup and support costs. Spend more time using the software and less time operating it.&rdquo; This sounds great.</p>
<p>The docs are from another world. <a href="https://www.suffix.be/blog/joining-fediverse-honk/">Joining the Fediverse with honk - Suffix</a></p>
<h1 id="comparing-the-three-options">Comparing the three options</h1>
<p>The conclusion is as follows: Start with Akkoma and see how it works; perhaps install GoToSocial and honk afterwards. It could be interesting to move forward with a maximum contrast, as in: Akkoma, honk, GoToSocial.</p>
<p>This is my qualitative assessment based on the information above.</p>

<h1 id="prior-and-next-steps">Prior and next steps</h1>
<p>The above assessment is from the 19th of July. Before this, I explored and expanded the hardware setup. We started setting up the software in Bochum, but many things happened. And the university&rsquo;s network infrastructure is not made for static IPs, especially in our building. And then folks were busy. It took way too long to publish this, and research in Vietnam lay in between. We started with a solar Panel made for a Pi. But it does not produce enough power. So a proper 100w solar panel feeding a mobile battery is the solution. That&rsquo;s at least what I thought it was.</p>
<p>So the next steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting up the Pi with a static Wifi IP</li>
<li>Installing Akkoma (with the most efficient solution, perhaps Docker, however that works)</li>
<li>Document the process</li>
<li>Using the solar-power of lovely Vietnam in front ouf our appartment</li>
</ul>
<p>I already completed this process, almost. It’s worth another article. The text is planned for February of 2024 to be published in our collaborative research centre&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.virtuelle-lebenswelten.de/blog-post/vom-dezember-lidar-sensordaten-in-autonomen-fahrzeugen">Virtual Object of the Month series</a>.</p>

			 <p>With this post, I want to bring a color to the blog, show how I experience my daily life as a researcher in Vietnam, and how I follow material infrastructures. It&rsquo;s going on in bits and pieces, and some is a patchwork. Last not least, this is also a means of sharing links and snapshots.</p>
<h2 id="bits--trees-of-data-centres">Bits &amp; Trees of Data Centres</h2>
<p>What does it actually mean to trace and traverse the infrastructure and production networks of a very specific building? That in itself is a difficult question, and in our research project in Bochum we are playing out this problem on a data center on top of that.</p>
<p>Estrid and I recently published a first article on this in the sustainability-oriented Bits &amp; Bäume issue, <a href="https://publication2023.bits-und-baeume.org">see for the full book here</a> and in <a href="https://stefanlaser.net/portfolio/current/">this post</a>.</p>
<p>When it comes to on-the-ground arrangements, it&rsquo;s often very concrete. We see flashing servers, smoking heads, convivial interlocutors, but also cables hidden on the minus sixth floor in a tunnel. My role in this research is less direct though, as leads are quickly lost. Where does the path lead if we take the computers and materials seriously, if semiconductors and atoms guide the way?</p>
<h2 id="from-anatomy-to-patches">From Anatomy to patches?</h2>
<p>With the Anatomy of AI project, researchers have impressively shown how an incredible number of connections are attached to such a small device as an Amazon Speaker. There are also lives hanging on it, due to the precarious working conditions, from the dark mine to the orange laser to the gray-dusty assembly area.</p>
<p>Check out the Anatomy of AI project of Kate Crawford and Vladan Joler, it&rsquo;s a magnificient beauty:
<a href="https://anatomyof.ai/img/ai-anatomy-map.pdf">anatomyof.ai/img/ai-an&hellip;</a></p>
<p>Moving on.</p>
<p>Computer chips are, at their core, plates of sand with carvings that are only a few atoms in size. They make data centres what they are, high-performances clusters in particular, which is what our &ldquo;building&rdquo; is also aiming for. Innovations on an ultra-small scale have led to large-scale shifts in the last century. And this is currently happening again, according to my research. The chip industry has its centers, much is concentrated in China and non-China aka Taiwan. But thanks to Corona, the US-China trade war and other political-economic reasons, things are currently changing.  It&rsquo;s a hot topic.</p>

<h2 id="thinking-sea">Thinking SEA</h2>
<p>Countries like Vietnam are leaving their mark on the world map of IT production networks.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>I am in contact with the first stakeholders, but I have to take it slowly. Growth via IT is welcome in Vietnam. Questions rather less. There is a lot at stake. A lot is in the news. I say little.</p>
<p>And so for the first weeks and months in the so-called Far East, in the Asia-Pacific, I am concerned with understanding moods and pleasant tones. Of many impressions. In the process, the first patches and speculations come together.</p>
<p>As the above links show, something like a new high-tech industry is growing in Vietnam. There are massive tech parks, even here in my immediate vicinity in Hanoi. I have not arrived there yet.

<h2 id="energy-driving">Energy driving</h2>
<p>Energy drives me, not only as a topic of my habilitation. What happens if I&rsquo;m in an elevator and the power goes out? As of June 2023, this is a real danger; we are plagued by &ldquo;planned blackouts,&rdquo; the planning for which unfortunately escapes us and our neighbors. Renewable energies are to be advanced in a new program, after a long period of standstill, but only more coal can provide for more stability in the short and medium term.</p>
<p>To cite the Vietnam Weekly newsletter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hydro and coal account for nearly 95% of northern Vietnam’s energy supply (split almost evenly), but the former is running at 24% of capacity and the latter is at 76.6%.
<a href="https://vietnamweekly.substack.com/p/power-outages-hammer-the-north">Vietnam Weekly: Power Outages Hammer the North</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also have coal in mind mind on a daily basis, travelling across the city. With masks, as most people do.</p>
<p><img src="/img/cycling.webp" alt="Thinking and driving through air pollution"></p>
<p>Mind how the so-called street ninja tackle this (and sexism) in Vietnam:
<a href="https://e.vnexpress.net/projects/street-ninjas-battle-sexism-and-the-sun-in-vietnam-3651101/index.html">e.vnexpress.net/projects/&hellip;</a></p>
<p>How do such energy considerations permeate the data center industry? It thinks in terms of efficiency, in terms of the logic of increases, and this is how it interprets the sustainability debate, just like many politicians. For me, it will be a matter of looking more at the inconspicuous costs, that which is needed materially for production.</p>

<p>How can social science research address planetary concerns and be designed carefully? Two recent articles in Science &amp; Technology Studies address this question with a view to different cases: Conference Mobility on the one hand and Decentralized Social Media on the other.</p>
<h2 id="jumping-on-the-bandwagon">Jumping on the bandwagon</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://www.easst.net/article/fieldnotes-on-flyingless-conferencing/"><em>Fieldnotes on FlyingLess Conferencing</em></a> we discuss our different experiences as train travelers to the EASST conference in Madrid. Some of them were long journeys through Europe, including stops. But it is possible, in Europe the plane is not without alternative, even if the scattered infrastructure does not always make it easy.</p>
<p>A quote from our text (that is, by <a href="https://www.easst.net/article/fieldnotes-on-flyingless-conferencing/#authors">Vanessa Ashall, Tobias Held, Stefan Laser, Julie Sascia Mewes, Mace Ojala, Nona Schulte-Roemer, Robert Smith, Richard Tutton, Sine Zambach</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Initiatives such as <a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/flyingless/">Flying Less</a> and podcasts by the <a href="https://twitter.com/oxford_policy">Oxford University Flyingless Group</a> provide information, discussion and practical suggestions on how we as individual academics can alter our practices, but also how to challenge our institutions and professional associations. There are also discussions on how to organise conferences in hybrid or hub-like formats to reduce travel activities. For the recently held EASST 2022 conference in July, some delegates decided to journey by long-distance train across Europe to reach Madrid. As one would expect from a group of STS scholars, this was not done without some appreciation of the sociotechnical challenges involved and of course with that long standing commitment of our field that ‘things could be otherwise’.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="shooting-down-the-bird">Shooting down the bird</h2>
<p>Digital communication has become a cornerstone of academic exchange, internally and with media and partners. In the fall and winter of 2022, Twitter and Elon Musk respectively have attracted some attention. The &ldquo;Birdsite&rdquo; is no longer the same; now it has become a right-wing agitation platform, with dubious blue-flagged accounts hijacking the discourse. But you can&rsquo;t do without social media, at least it makes sense to explore other forms of participation. With Fediverse, Mastodon, and other popular apps like PeerTube and Calckey, a veritable alternative is growing that is of utmost relevance to STS researchers.</p>
<p>We used the timing and discussions on Twitter and Mastodon to think about platform design and an &ldquo;Other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A quote from the post by <a href="https://www.easst.net/article/the-environmental-footprint-of-social-media-hosting-tinkering-with-mastodon/#authors">Stefan Laser, Anne Pasek, Estrid Sørensen, Mél Hogan, Mace Ojala, Jens Fehrenbacher, Maximilian Gregor Hepach, Leman Çelik, Koushik Ravi Kumar</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What kinds of worlds are not probable but <em>possible</em> from the ruins of Twitter? Mastodon might not be the next big thing. Yet it is an exciting network that many people are experimenting with and, for STS scholars, offers entry points to learn through practical engagement. Perhaps more important than Mastodon per se is the idea of <em>othernets</em> (Dourish 2017 chapter 7); the internet we have is not a necessity, and might take a very different shape and feel different based on new collectivities. If Mastodon has a less devastating impact on the environment, what else about our internet can we change, or make a case for changing?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In such initiatives, it remains crucial to move away from individual responsibility to discuss structural interdependencies and collective mobilization. This is what the <a href="http://lowcarbonmethods.com/">low-carbon research method group does</a>, for example. I will use this blog to discuss my own experiences with research pratices and material infrastructures.</p>

<p>My main research theme right now is data centres: their local arrangement, material legacies, building procedures, and global production networks enabling its operation. The study is conducted in the collaborative research centre 1567 Virtual Life Worlds, in subproject A02 led by Estrid Sørensen.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the pitch of the project?
As information infrastructures, data centres help shape scientific knowledge production. As consumers of raw materials and energy, they contribute to shaping natural processes. This ethnographic study combines research on the interdependence of socio-technical practices in a university data centre and scientific data practices with an ethnography of the value chain from extraction of raw materials and energy production to operation and use of the data centre. It thus answers both the theoretical and empirical question of the continuity of nature and knowledge.</p>
<p>More info <a href="https://www.sfb1567.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/forschung/infrastrukturen">can be found here</a>.
Check out the online lecture series we did: <a href="https://rustlab.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/across_layers/">Across the Layers: Scientific Knowledge Production, Planetary Resources, and Data Centres</a>.</p>
<h2 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h2>
<p>In the context of the research centre, individual and collective publications are produced, and beyond that I am interested in collaborations that advance the research conceptually or empirically. Currently, I am based abroad in Vietnam and am investigating the question of what material investments are necessary for the design and construction of (sometimes extremely efficient) chips that require data centres. Southeast Asia is a good base for this work, because central nodes of value chains can be found here, and because current, including political, developments are changing the structure of value chains and revealing dependencies as well as new opportunities.</p>
<h2 id="publication">Publication</h2>
<p>In an article for Bits &amp; Bäume, we discuss the implications of our research for transformations towards sustainable IT.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Discussions of data centre sustainability often address technical improvements
and political regulations. Innovations make data centres more energy efficient, and
political guidelines help – and force – industry to prioritise environmental sustainability. Such innovations are important, but they tend to overlook implementation.</p>

<p>Climate change and environmental issues call for an ecological transformation of production and consumption. In Germany, the transport sector is considered the &ldquo;troubled child&rdquo; of the transformation, because emissions in the mobility sector have not fallen in recent decades, in contrast to other sectors. But there are signs of change – the car industry has been criticised since the &ldquo;diesel scandal&rdquo; and, alongside electric mobility, e-fuels and cycling, the rail industry is seen as a beacon of hope. The industry emphasises its importance for climate and ecology and can thus establish a stable new reference in the public.</p>

All data and code is on <a href="https://github.com/LaserStefan/Verkehrswende_railway">Github.</a></p>
<p>Yet the situation is ambivalent. To better understand this dynamic, the first part of this article works through the transport transition discourse with a focus on rail transport. Extensive data from the social media platform Twitter serve as a basis. This part gives an overview of the actors involved and their positions and shows competing understandings of the transport transition as well as the multiplicity of problem ideas. From a qualitative perspective, the second part discusses two innovative projects in rail transport: the &ldquo;Green Function of Movement Control&rdquo;, which brings a kind of green wave to rail, and the &ldquo;Digital Automatic Coupling&rdquo;, which is intended to replace a coupling technology in freight transport that is more than 150 years old. However, it becomes apparent that the ecological transformation at the workplace rail is fleeting. The railways themselves are not driving any transformation, because they are instead preoccupied with issues of obsolescence – i.e. issues of ageing – i.e. with repair, maintenance, servicing as well as old technology and entrenched, slowly grown administration. This is not a problem per se, but an adequate description of the work and competences that are necessary to keep a rail network alive – and that need to be appreciated. If there is to be a change in transport by and with the railways, it will only work with less and slower traffic, also on the railways.</p>

			 <p>More hands-on skills: From Data Science to Graph Analysis.</p>
<p>In addition to qualitative, ethnographic methods, I work with digital research approaches. They enrich the qualitative analysis.
I specialise in the analysis and preparation of public controversies. I work mainly with Gephi, Python and R and focus on data analytics. See also <a href="https://github.com/LaserStefan">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, I&rsquo;m interested in open science and knowledge and love to experiment with software, seemingly wasting many hours on testing and deploying setups. This is often connected with ecological matters, when, for example, it is about exploring the ecological footprint of data centres used for social media. For a collective experiment, see for example the <a href="https://disaster-sts-network.org/">Disaster STS collective</a>, to which I contribute.
See this <a href="https://disaster-sts-network.org/content/ruhr-valley-and-delhi-megacity-air-pollution-germany-and-india">report on air pollution</a>.</p>

			 <p>My central methodological competence: participant observation, immersion, following materials, expert knowledge and situated practices.</p>
<p>The qualitative, participatory lens is a research ethos for me, it involves participating in core practices of social actors, acquiring and reconstructing expert knowledge, and generally being creative with different sources of data.</p>
<p>Ethnography is a non-standardized research method in the social and cultural sciences, focusing on the collection of data, actors, perspectives, narratives, objects or curiosities. It is a more qualitative approach, but because of its problem-centered focus here, it also incorporates quantitative methods for exploration. Ethnographic research can be summed up with one imperative: Follow the actors.</p>
<p>In my research, I combine interviews and document analysis with quantitative approaches from the Digital Humanities. The processing of large datasets and networks of digital data serves to enrich the qualitative research. In general, the research is globally embedded, with a focus on Central Europe and Asia, as well as the many digital spaces in between.</p>
<p>Practical examples of my ethnographic research include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a multi-month study of e-waste recycling in a smelter as an intern to theorize the value of waste;</li>
<li>a document analysis of an Indian law, underpinned and guided by interviews with experts, to decode the history and embeddedness of the law;</li>
<li>analyses of controversies on Twitter using timelines, hashtag correlation and networks of tweet mentions to examine social change and social order;</li>
<li>exploration of the ecological footprint of social networks via the construction of a dedicated Mastodon instance with a loosely affiliated, globally distributed research group;</li>

<p>Global and interdisciplinary research on e-waste: ethnographic studies in Germany, India, and across social media platforms.</p>
<p>Key for this research is a book I published: Hightech at the end.</p>
<p>Hightech at the end examines the global recycling of electronic waste by studying multiple sites: ethnographic observations help unravel political negotiations on sustainability in India, the in-house value chain of a German recycling company is scrutinized, and a failed Google innovation is discussed.</p>
<p>The Intro: Moving away from individual consumption</p>
<p>Electronic waste is a unique and fascinating waste stream. It keeps popping up on the news. The mountain of waste is growing – more than 50 million tons per year, as the United Nations University estimates in its renowned “E-Waste” reports. And at the same time, consumers learn from the many reports about the strange routes that ‘their’ e-waste takes after disposal. These are usually stories in which things like old computers travel to the global south, to West Africa or Asia.</p>
<p>What is being conveyed is a general uncertainty. Too little is happening. Garbage is not only not avoided, but it also makes conditions and life even worse. Individual consumption makes life in the distance worse. But this argument is misleading. Critical researcher points out that such reports reproduce racism and increase inequalities.</p>
<p>High-tech at the end presents an alternative perspective. There is by no means little being done in dealing with electronic waste. The legal and industrial changes are just difficult to grasp. They take place on an infrastructural level that requires special attention. At the same time, the book’s core argument is that this is why the focus on individual responsibility – on households, for example – falls far short. It is industrial practices that are responsible for most waste and the most toxic waste; consumers cannot control this and do not even know about many industrial routines. “Infrastructures,” the book argues, “related production systems and their path dependencies are mainly responsible for material output, i.e. energy consumption, residues and waste. The ratios are difficult to estimate, but only between 3 and 9 per cent of e-waste is household waste, and even this waste is highly mediated. The exact calculation of this is not of central importance here, this is a controversy in itself, as the academic blog “Discard Studies” shows in detail.</p>
<p>High-tech in the end develops the argument that an infrastructure of high-tech recycling has been established over the last three decades. You have to look at this infrastructure if you want to understand how waste is handled. By examining the everyday work on and with the high-tech infrastructure, taking into account its history, one gains a new view of social structures and dynamics.</p>
<h2 id="towards-a-new-e-waste-policy">Towards a new e-waste policy</h2>
<p>High-tech at the end discusses a variety of approaches to address the issues, including a critical look at the current European recycling industry. It should be viewed critically because it discusses waste in a rather one-sided way, usually in a negative way, i.e. as a hazard. Repair in particular offers potential here, while it is not held in very high esteem, especially when compared with the significant funding initiatives that shredder and smelting companies receive.</p>
<p>In the fourth part of the book, political questions are played through, and the focus is on political consequences and new democratic impulses. It is a plea for a new examination of very selected questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How can the recycling industry really put industrial responsibility at the centre? There is a great deal of creativity and political urge in dealing with household waste. How can the reach be increased to tackle waste prevention aggressively?
How can knowledge about the quantities and distribution of different types of electronic waste be improved? (Because estimates such as the ratio of household and industrial waste are currently only rough estimates, which emphasizes the problem).
How can the reparability of electronic equipment be promoted? For example, how far does the announced EU law on the “right to repair” go? How can the causes of obsolescence be better researched, beyond stereotypes?
How can local initiatives be fostered to empower users?
How can global solidarity be built, and how can initiatives learn from each other?
How can a project like the Fairphone become more than a “proof of concept”? How does the political responsibility of the big producers come into focus?
What kind of waste should be produced? Which dirty materials are acceptable, how many, where? How can such questions be approached democratically? Do proactive regulations of other industries offer good examples?</p>
