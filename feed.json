				"content_html": "<p>You have probably come across this post, but in case you have not, get ready for a thorough analysis that is not only for pollution or tech nerds. (But it&rsquo;s certainly ALSO for those people.)</p>\n<p>In &ldquo;How Google is killing independent sites like ours&rdquo;, the independent website HouseFresh goes into the details to show why Google Search has deteriorated &ndash; has become shit, as Cory Doctorow puts it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://housefresh.com/david-vs-digital-goliaths/\">housefresh.com/david-vs-&hellip;</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Savvy SEOs at big media publishers (or third-party vendors hired by them) realised that they could create pages for ‘best of’ product recommendations without the need to invest any time or effort in actually testing and reviewing the products first.\nSo, they peppered their pages with references to a ‘rigorous testing process,’ their ‘lab team,’ subject matter experts ‘they collaborated with,’ and complicated methodologies that seem impressive at a cursory look.\nSometimes, they even added photos of ‘tests’ with products covered in Post-it notes, someone holding a tape measure, and people with very ‘scientific’ clipboards.\nThere’s nothing wrong with wanting to show you’re doing the thing you’re supposed to be doing, <strong>but what happens when that’s as far as you go?</strong>\nAll they had to do was say what they needed to say to pass a manual check if it came to that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is a particular case, air purifiers, but everyone knows these weird websites HouseFresh is talking about. At least when you&rsquo;re using the internet to order things. Which is virtually everyone since at least Covid.</p>\n<h1 id=\"what-to-do-with-air-pollution-data\">What to do with air pollution data?</h1>\n<p>I study waste for 10 years, and thinking about air pollution is part of this project. This has also to do with my studies in India back in 2012, when I was (severely) sick from the air pollution. I also almost ran an air pollution research project, but the grant competition was too high. Anyway, since then I have been eager to follow public discussions around air pollution and how the public is engaged.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a new piece by the brilliant <em>Rest of the World</em> magazine that puts a focus on South Asia. Like many features on waste and pollution, it takes a research stance and introduces ✨data✨. It&rsquo;s great. But what&rsquo;s the point if the data is boring because it&rsquo;s so obvious?</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Riders in the Smog&rdquo; is the title of this piece, and in this the authors equipped gig workers with pollution monitors. It&rsquo;s a fairly specific consumer brand (Atmotube Pro) with proprietary data interpretations, yet it gets the job done. &ldquo;The readings were off the charts.&rdquo; Sort of. Or, as it&rsquo;s described in a scene.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://restofworld.org/2024/riders-in-the-smog-gig-workers-pollution/\">restofworld.org/2024/ride&hellip;</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Alongside tracking specific pollutants, the Atmotube Pro gives an overall real-time air quality score (AQS) from 0–100, with zero being the most severely polluted, and 100 being the cleanest. According to Atmo, the company that makes the Atmotube monitors, a reading of 0–20 should be considered a health alert, under which conditions “everyone should avoid all outdoor exertion.” But the three gig workers found their monitors consistently displayed the lowest possible score.\nAs Iqbal went about his work picking up and dropping off customers, his pollution monitor barely budged from a score of zero. “Is this device even working?” he asked.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You cannot divide by 0. There is no fragment of healthy air in everyday life in Lahore, New Delhi, and Dhaka. It&rsquo;s slightly better indoors. But that does not translate to healthy. It just moves from &ldquo;hazardous&rdquo; to &ldquo;very unhealthy&rdquo;. (This is something that is only told by the genius categories introduced by the Air Quality Index. It made the grade choice of not setting an upper limit, so that the PM1s, 2s, 10s and VOCs can keep on rising and we may through a daunting colour and name at it.</p>\n<p>There is also a methodology article on this:\n<a href=\"https://restofworld.org/2024/riders-in-the-smog-air-quality-methodology/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feeds\">https://restofworld.org/2024/riders-in-the-smog-air-quality-methodology/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feeds</a></p>\n<p>While the data is not particularly useful, I enjoyed how the authors talked to medical staff and their recent experiences. This is how to add quality and concrete experiences. Recently, I have become to know the troubling perspective through Hanoi people: It&rsquo;s bad but I still do relatively fine. A bit of coughing, it will be gone. But there are many stories of people, and tough <em>Schicksalsschläge</em>, that are worth reporting.</p>\n<h1 id=\"podcast-of-the-week\">Podcast of the week</h1>\n<p>I like to include podcast in this, one podcast if possible. Yet it had to be two this week. Mél and Anne had their (often shared) discussion on how to make sense of (data centre) efficiency (data), and the politics of engagement. Go Data Fix!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/the-data-fix/episodes/efficient-with-anne-pasek\">shows.acast.com/the-data-&hellip;</a></p>\n<p>And then there is fellow German waste scholar (LMU Munich and Uni Augsburg, now Heisenberg Professor in Oxford) Simone Müller who was on the Edge Effects show. Dial in for a wild ride on waste colonialism.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://edgeeffects.net/simone-muller/\">edgeeffects.net/simone-mu&hellip;</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I feel environmental justice has done a lot of work to go the civil rights route. We see scholars and a lot of national activists coming to think about civil rights—what that means for non-discriminatory disposal of hazardous waste or also the situated mass of dirty industries in particular communities. But interestingly, they have done little oftentimes to pivot to the notion of other universal rights—universal civil rights versus something like that could almost be framed as “separate but equal” on a global scale.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I found this podcast because someone recommended it on Mastodon. A Segway. Swoosh.</p>\n<h1 id=\"talking-new-and-new-old-web-again\">Talking new and new old web again</h1>\n<p>Vice apparently shuts down, because of odd management. Platform decay, see above.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.404media.co/behind-the-blog-vices-legacy-and-the-idea-that-the-internet-is-forever/\">www.404media.co/behind-th&hellip;</a>\n<a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/24/anti-posse/\">pluralistic.net/2024/02/2&hellip;</a></p>\n<p>Also consider how Reddit is doing the next step of selling its user/data base.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.404media.co/reddit-we-are-in-the-early-stages-of-monetizing-our-user-base-2/\">www.404media.co/reddit-we&hellip;</a></p>\n<p>AND WORDPRESS</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://tante.cc/2024/02/27/the-automattic-ai-thing/\">tante.cc/2024/02/2&hellip;</a></p>\n<p>This website POSSE here and independent networks like the Fediverse are one way to tackle the issue. But this new thinking can go in different directions. A few examples I compiled this week are the following.</p>\n<p>Remember your first website from the 1990s or early 2000s? Ashamed/proud of the looks? I only now realized that there are extensive networks of websites that help you create these wonderful pages again. Neocities is the most prominent one.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://neocities.org/\">neocities.org</a></p>\n<p>(Also remember the past when annoyed users created a People Against Under Construction Images manifesto that is still life today. Rehearse!)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.andrews.edu/~rickyr/noconst.html\">www.andrews.edu/~rickyr/n&hellip;</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Under Construction images are never seen at highly popular and constantly changing web sites such as Netscape CNN, Yahoo!, or Lycos. If the best don&rsquo;t do it, neither should the worst. Under Construction Images should be removed from the layout of all Web pages. Take yours off now!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ok, boomer.</p>\n<p>Lastly, embrace this: Towards a quieter, friendlier web:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://coryd.dev/posts/2024/towards-a-quieter-friendlier-web/\">coryd.dev/posts/202&hellip;</a></p>\n<p>With gems such as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Share what you enjoy or what you&rsquo;re curious about. Not everyone will enjoy of it, some people will appreciate different things, but build friendships on mutual interests. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to say you don&rsquo;t know something. Being forthright and asking for help is an admirable quality.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1 id=\"wrap-up\">Wrap up</h1>\n<p>I try to do these dumps regularly now. A brief holiday was in between this and the more recent post. Let me know what you think in the comments and leave a kudos.</p>\n<p>One more thing. The snapshots I include are Fuji pictures from the region.

(But it's certainly ALSO for those people.) \r\n\r\nIn \"How Google is killing independent sites like ours\", the independent website HouseFresh goes into the details to show why Google Search has deteriorated -- has become shit, as Cory Doctorow puts it.\r\n\r\n[housefresh.com/david-vs-...](https://housefresh.com/david-vs-digital-goliaths/)\r\n\r\n> Savvy SEOs at big media publishers (or third-party vendors hired by them) realised that they could create pages for ‘best of’ product recommendations without the need to invest any time or effort in actually testing and reviewing the products first.\r\n> So, they peppered their pages with references to a ‘rigorous testing process,’ their ‘lab team,’ subject matter experts ‘they collaborated with,’ and complicated methodologies that seem impressive at a cursory look. \r\n> Sometimes, they even added photos of ‘tests’ with products covered in Post-it notes, someone holding a tape measure, and people with very ‘scientific’ clipboards. \r\n>There’s nothing wrong with wanting to show you’re doing the thing you’re supposed to be doing, **but what happens when that’s as far as you go?**\r\n> All they had to do was say what they needed to say to pass a manual check if it came to that. \r\n\r\nIt is a particular case, air purifiers, but everyone knows these weird websites HouseFresh is talking about. At least when you're using the internet to order things. Which is virtually everyone since at least Covid.\r\n\r\n# What to do with air pollution data?\r\nI study waste for 10 years, and thinking about air pollution is part of this project. This has also to do with my studies in India back in 2012, when I was (severely) sick from the air pollution. I also almost ran an air pollution research project, but the grant competition was too high. Anyway, since then I have been eager to follow public discussions around air pollution and how the public is engaged.\r\n\r\nThere's a new piece by the brilliant *Rest of the World* magazine that puts a focus on South Asia. Like many features on waste and pollution, it takes a research stance and introduces ✨data✨. It's great. But what's the point if the data is boring because it's so obvious?\r\n\r\n\"Riders in the Smog\" is the title of this piece, and in this the authors equipped gig workers with pollution monitors. It's a fairly specific consumer brand (Atmotube Pro) with proprietary data interpretations, yet it gets the job done. \"The readings were off the charts.\" Sort of. Or, as it's described in a scene.\r\n\r\n[restofworld.org/2024/ride...](https://restofworld.org/2024/riders-in-the-smog-gig-workers-pollution/)\r\n\r\n> Alongside tracking specific pollutants, the Atmotube Pro gives an overall real-time air quality score (AQS) from 0–100, with zero being the most severely polluted, and 100 being the cleanest. According to Atmo, the company that makes the Atmotube monitors, a reading of 0–20 should be considered a health alert, under which conditions “everyone should avoid all outdoor exertion.” But the three gig workers found their monitors consistently displayed the lowest possible score. \r\n>As Iqbal went about his work picking up and dropping off customers, his pollution monitor barely budged from a score of zero. “Is this device even working?” he asked.\r\n\r\nYou cannot divide by 0. There is no fragment of healthy air in everyday life in Lahore, New Delhi, and Dhaka. It's slightly better indoors. But that does not translate to healthy. It just moves from \"hazardous\" to \"very unhealthy\". (This is something that is only told by the genius categories introduced by the Air Quality Index. It made the grade choice of not setting an upper limit, so that the PM1s, 2s, 10s and VOCs can keep on rising and we may through a daunting colour and name at it.\r\n\r\nThere is also a methodology article on this:\r\nhttps://restofworld.org/2024/riders-in-the-smog-air-quality-methodology/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=feeds\r\n\r\nWhile the data is not particularly useful, I enjoyed how the authors talked to medical staff and their recent experiences. This is how to add quality and concrete experiences. Recently, I have become to know the troubling perspective through Hanoi people: It's bad but I still do relatively fine. A bit of coughing, it will be gone. But there are many stories of people, and tough *Schicksalsschläge*, that are worth reporting.\r\n\r\n# Podcast of the week\r\nI like to include podcast in this, one podcast if possible. Yet it had to be two this week. Mél and Anne had their (often shared) discussion on how to make sense of (data centre) efficiency (data), and the politics of engagement. Go Data Fix!\r\n\r\n[shows.acast.com/the-data-...](https://shows.acast.com/the-data-fix/episodes/efficient-with-anne-pasek)\r\n\r\nAnd then there is fellow German waste scholar (LMU Munich and Uni Augsburg, now Heisenberg Professor in Oxford) Simone Müller who was on the Edge Effects show. Dial in for a wild ride on waste colonialism.\r\n\r\n[edgeeffects.net/simone-mu...](https://edgeeffects.net/simone-muller/) \r\n\r\n> I feel environmental justice has done a lot of work to go the civil rights route. We see scholars and a lot of national activists coming to think about civil rights—what that means for non-discriminatory disposal of hazardous waste or also the situated mass of dirty industries in particular communities. But interestingly, they have done little oftentimes to pivot to the notion of other universal rights—universal civil rights versus something like that could almost be framed as “separate but equal” on a global scale.\r\n\r\nI found this podcast because someone recommended it on Mastodon. A Segway. Swoosh.\r\n\r\n# Talking new and new old web again\r\nVice apparently shuts down, because of odd management. Platform decay, see above. \r\n\r\n[www.404media.co/behind-th...](https://www.404media.co/behind-the-blog-vices-legacy-and-the-idea-that-the-internet-is-forever/)\r\n[pluralistic.net/2024/02/2...](https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/24/anti-posse/)\r\n\r\nAlso consider how Reddit is doing the next step of selling its user/data base.\r\n\r\n[www.404media.co/reddit-we...](https://www.404media.co/reddit-we-are-in-the-early-stages-of-monetizing-our-user-base-2/)\r\n\r\nAND WORDPRESS\r\n\r\n[tante.cc/2024/02/2...](https://tante.cc/2024/02/27/the-automattic-ai-thing/)\r\n\r\nThis website POSSE here and independent networks like the Fediverse are one way to tackle the issue. But this new thinking can go in different directions. A few examples I compiled this week are the following.\r\n\r\nRemember your first website from the 1990s or early 2000s? Ashamed/proud of the looks? I only now realized that there are extensive networks of websites that help you create these wonderful pages again. Neocities is the most prominent one.\r\n\r\n[neocities.org](https://neocities.org/)\r\n\r\n(Also remember the past when annoyed users created a People Against Under Construction Images manifesto that is still life today. Rehearse!)\r\n\r\n[www.andrews.edu/~rickyr/n...](https://www.andrews.edu/~rickyr/noconst.html)\r\n\r\n> Under Construction images are never seen at highly popular and constantly changing web sites such as Netscape CNN, Yahoo!, or Lycos. If the best don't do it, neither should the worst. Under Construction Images should be removed from the layout of all Web pages. Take yours off now!\r\n\r\nOk, boomer.\r\n\r\nLastly, embrace this: Towards a quieter, friendlier web:\r\n\r\n[coryd.dev/posts/202...](https://coryd.dev/posts/2024/towards-a-quieter-friendlier-web/)\r\n\r\nWith gems such as:\r\n> Share what you enjoy or what you're curious about. Not everyone will enjoy of it, some people will appreciate different things, but build friendships on mutual interests. Don't be afraid to say you don't know something. Being forthright and asking for help is an admirable quality.\r\n\r\n# Wrap up\r\nI try to do these dumps regularly now. A brief holiday was in between this and the more recent post. Let me know what you think in the comments and leave a kudos.\r\n\r\nOne more thing. The snapshots I include are Fuji pictures from the region. I think this period of AI hype that also tries to get rid of the creative arts is a perfect time to embrace photography, and more.\r\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/129890/2024/fan.jpg\" width=\"399\" height=\"600\" alt=\"An image of air condiction fans outside a restaurant building in KL, Malaysia.

				"content_html": "<p>Starting off with an odd one: Big Oil apparently funded climate science since the early 1950s. And it was Keeling himself at the centre. Think Keeling curves and long-term CO2 measurements. But it sounds like a different time. Less evil still, so that Keeling could use this funding for the good. Part of this story is that differences between air pollution and CO2 emissions were much less clear.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.desmog.com/2024/01/30/fossil-fuel-industry-sponsored-climate-science-1954-keeling-api-wspa/\">www.desmog.com/2024/01/3&hellip;</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Newly discovered documents affirm that the automobile and petroleum industries funded early climate science Keeling conducted at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) between 1954 and 1956. Records show that &ldquo;oil and auto companies&rdquo; sponsored the scientist&rsquo;s research via an organization called the Southern California Air Pollution Foundation, formed in 1953 to tackle Los Angeles&rsquo;s infamous smog. American Motors, Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors were among 18 automotive companies that gave money to the foundation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Fast forward to the future of the present.

My thanks to all of the presenters for joining and sharing expertise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Many things are happening, it seems. Also, on the regulatory side. My current prime example of semiconductor manufacturing gets hotter every year, with tighter climate rules approaching. There&rsquo;s yet another one:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.northcountrypublicradio.org/news/npr/1228540721/the-epa-is-proposing-that-forever-chemicals-be-considered-hazardous-substances\">www.northcountrypublicradio.org/news/npr/&hellip;</a></p>\n<p>But, as Gerry McGovern notes, how much does it count?</p>\n<h1 id=\"podcast-of-the-week\">Podcast of the week</h1>\n<p>I happen to share one podcast per week, and here is an episode of Drilled that you surely should not miss, featuring a &ldquo;messy conversation&rdquo; on the climate movement w/ Rhiana Gunn-Wright. Slightly tilted towards the American culture war, but quickly turning global. It also fits to the link mentioned before. Why are companies sending powerful signals to care for <em>global</em> emissions, but ignore to take into consideration affected communities next door?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drilled.media/podcasts/drilled/10/messyconversations-rhiana\">drilled.media/podcasts/&hellip;</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rhiana Gunn-Wright was one of the architects of the Green New Deal, and today works as the climate policy director for the Roosevelt Institute. In this episode we get into the nuances of the IRA, how to handle climate being a &ldquo;culture war&rdquo; issue, what&rsquo;s going on with anti-renewables, and what the climate movement loses when it turns its back on justice issues and particularly when it turns its back on the Black community.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1 id=\"the-new-web-of-scams\">The new web of scams</h1>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve recently framed the turn toward non-commercial web applications as a turn toward the lovely new web. Let&rsquo;s not forget that it&rsquo;s full of scams, too.</p>\n<p>A phenomenal example is propaganda in India made by and for Modi.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/03/world/asia/india-modi-ayodhya-media.html\">www.nytimes.com/2024/02/0&hellip;</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In moments of political tension, stars with huge followings put out nearly copy-and-paste messages of support. And as the election nears, cabinet ministers have turned to podcasts and online broadcasts with influencers to reach a generation that gets its information outside the traditional channels that Mr. Modi has co-opted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Cory Doctorow covers the more individual side of scams. Scams, basically. Reaching out when you&rsquo;re most vulnerable.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/05/cyber-dunning-kruger/\">pluralistic.net/2024/02/0&hellip;</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I find the inner workings of scams to be fascinating, and it&rsquo;s also important to remind people that everyone is vulnerable sometimes, and scammers are willing to try endless variations until an attack lands at just the right place, at just the right time, in just the right way. If you think you can&rsquo;t get scammed, that makes you especially vulnerable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Cory nailed it once again with another post this day, calling out Apple for its corruption, and blatantly misreading EU regulation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a strain of anti-anti-monopolist that insists that they&rsquo;re not pro-monopoly – they&rsquo;re just realists who understand that global gigacorporations are too big to fail, too big to jail, and that governments can&rsquo;t hope to rein them in. Trying to regulate a tech giant, they say, is like trying to regulate the weather.\nThis ploy is cousins with Jay Rosen&rsquo;s idea of &ldquo;savvying,&rdquo; defined as: &ldquo;dismissing valid questions with the insider&rsquo;s, &lsquo;and this surprises you?&rsquo;&rdquo;\nThe reason this foolish nonsense flies is that we are living in an age of rampant corruption and utter impunity. Companies really do get away with both literal and figurative murder. Governments really do ignore horrible crimes by the rich and powerful, and fumble what rare, few enforcement efforts they assay.\nAnd then we get the details.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/06/spoil-the-bunch/\">pluralistic.net/2024/02/0&hellip;</a></p>\n<p>I rather keep working on the lovely new old web.

Yet it&rsquo;s a hectic time. The new year will be the year of the dragon (we&rsquo;re leaving the cat behind). Everyone on the streets felt tense. Better getting things sorted before you leave to the family events. I also saw some and heard about more road accidents.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, local police officers get tough on drunk driving.

				"content_text": "Starting off with an odd one: Big Oil apparently funded climate science since the early 1950s. And it was Keeling himself at the centre. Think Keeling curves and long-term CO2 measurements. But it sounds like a different time. Less evil still, so that Keeling could use this funding for the good. Part of this story is that differences between air pollution and CO2 emissions were much less clear.\r\n\r\n[www.desmog.com/2024/01/3...](https://www.desmog.com/2024/01/30/fossil-fuel-industry-sponsored-climate-science-1954-keeling-api-wspa/)\r\n\r\n> Newly discovered documents affirm that the automobile and petroleum industries funded early climate science Keeling conducted at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) between 1954 and 1956. Records show that \"oil and auto companies\" sponsored the scientist's research via an organization called the Southern California Air Pollution Foundation, formed in 1953 to tackle Los Angeles's infamous smog. American Motors, Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors were among 18 automotive companies that gave money to the foundation. \r\n\r\nFast forward to the future of the present. Here is a sweet summary of climate disasters and tipping points on different levels:\r\n\r\n[mastodon.social/@Snoro/11...](https://mastodon.social/@Snoro/111853274913962850)\r\n\r\nAnd if you crave Solarpunk alternative futures, follow this recent link list:\r\n\r\n[mastodon.floe.earth/@lex/1118...](https://mastodon.floe.earth/@lex/111878358709324423) \r\n\r\nTalking academic reflections, check out the videos of the ADM+S Electronics < > Ecologies series:\r\n\r\n[mastodon.social/@melgregg...](https://mastodon.social/@melgregg/111863085968773013)\r\n\r\n> 5 events, 4 cities, and so many excellent speakers. My thanks to all of the presenters for joining and sharing expertise.\r\n\r\nMany things are happening, it seems. Also, on the regulatory side. My current prime example of semiconductor manufacturing gets hotter every year, with tighter climate rules approaching. There's yet another one:\r\n\r\n[www.northcountrypublicradio.org/news/npr/...](https://www.northcountrypublicradio.org/news/npr/1228540721/the-epa-is-proposing-that-forever-chemicals-be-considered-hazardous-substances)\r\n\r\nBut, as Gerry McGovern notes, how much does it count?\r\n\r\n# Podcast of the week\r\nI happen to share one podcast per week, and here is an episode of Drilled that you surely should not miss, featuring a \"messy conversation\" on the climate movement w/ Rhiana Gunn-Wright. Slightly tilted towards the American culture war, but quickly turning global. It also fits to the link mentioned before. Why are companies sending powerful signals to care for *global* emissions, but ignore to take into consideration affected communities next door?\r\n\r\n[drilled.media/podcasts/...](https://drilled.media/podcasts/drilled/10/messyconversations-rhiana)\r\n\r\n> Rhiana Gunn-Wright was one of the architects of the Green New Deal, and today works as the climate policy director for the Roosevelt Institute. In this episode we get into the nuances of the IRA, how to handle climate being a \"culture war\" issue, what's going on with anti-renewables, and what the climate movement loses when it turns its back on justice issues and particularly when it turns its back on the Black community.\r\n\r\n# The new web of scams\r\nI've recently framed the turn toward non-commercial web applications as a turn toward the lovely new web. Let's not forget that it's full of scams, too.\r\n\r\nA phenomenal example is propaganda in India made by and for Modi.\r\n\r\n[www.nytimes.com/2024/02/0...](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/03/world/asia/india-modi-ayodhya-media.html) \r\n\r\n> In moments of political tension, stars with huge followings put out nearly copy-and-paste messages of support. And as the election nears, cabinet ministers have turned to podcasts and online broadcasts with influencers to reach a generation that gets its information outside the traditional channels that Mr. Modi has co-opted.\r\n\r\nCory Doctorow covers the more individual side of scams. Scams, basically. Reaching out when you're most vulnerable.\r\n\r\n[pluralistic.net/2024/02/0...](https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/05/cyber-dunning-kruger/)\r\n\r\n> I find the inner workings of scams to be fascinating, and it's also important to remind people that everyone is vulnerable sometimes, and scammers are willing to try endless variations until an attack lands at just the right place, at just the right time, in just the right way. If you think you can't get scammed, that makes you especially vulnerable.\r\n\r\nCory nailed it once again with another post this day, calling out Apple for its corruption, and blatantly misreading EU regulation.\r\n\r\n> There's a strain of anti-anti-monopolist that insists that they're not pro-monopoly – they're just realists who understand that global gigacorporations are too big to fail, too big to jail, and that governments can't hope to rein them in. Trying to regulate a tech giant, they say, is like trying to regulate the weather.\r\n> This ploy is cousins with Jay Rosen's idea of \"savvying,\" defined as: \"dismissing valid questions with the insider's, 'and this surprises you?'\"\r\n> The reason this foolish nonsense flies is that we are living in an age of rampant corruption and utter impunity. Companies really do get away with both literal and figurative murder. Governments really do ignore horrible crimes by the rich and powerful, and fumble what rare, few enforcement efforts they assay.\r\nAnd then we get the details.\r\n\r\n[pluralistic.net/2024/02/0...](https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/06/spoil-the-bunch/)\r\n\r\nI rather keep working on the lovely new old web. So here is one more of the encouraging examples, cherishing the open and un-commodifiable nature of RSS.\r\n\r\n[anildash.com/2024/02/0...](https://anildash.com/2024/02/06/wherever-you-get-podcasts/)\r\n\r\n# Vietnam welcoming the Dragon\r\nLunar new year is very close, and as you can see with the image attached, it's colourful and vibrant. Yet it's a hectic time. The new year will be the year of the dragon (we're leaving the cat behind). Everyone on the streets felt tense. Better getting things sorted before you leave to the family events. I also saw some and heard about more road accidents.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, local police officers get tough on drunk driving. Considering the high number of fatalities...this sounds like a good idea. But perhaps do it less random?\r\n\r\n[www.rfa.org/english/n...](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/vietnam/beer-01312024163003.html) \r\n\r\nTourists pouring in still complain about the \"lacklustre\" nightlife in Vietnam. Perhaps not a bad sign after all?\r\n\r\n[asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-...](https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/Tea-Leaves/Vietnam-s-lackluster-nightlife-symbolizes-official-inertia)\r\n\r\nLunar new year is like Christmas and New Year packed into one (maybe more on top), basically shutting down the urban centres. This is also the reason I will keep a low profile for a week.

Armies of fast-talking sales-reps fanned out across America, ringing dooorbells and sticking fliers in mailboxes, and lying like hell about how your new solar roof was gonna work out for you.\r\n\r\n> These hustlers tricked old and vulnerable people into signing up for arrangements that saw them saddled with ballooning debt payments (after a honeymoon period at a super-low teaser rate), backstopped by liens on their houses, which meant that missing a payment could mean losing your home.\r\n\r\nTo finish with multimedia: watch this episode about \"The KGB, The Computer and Me - The Cuckoo’s Egg Story\"\r\n\r\n[www.youtube.com/watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe5AE-qYan8)\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/129890/2024/dscf7057.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"Dirty yet sunny sky.

				"content_html": "<p>Here&rsquo;s a blog post on #hosting a microblogging instance on the #Fediverse with ecological concerns in mind. It&rsquo;s a longer one. And unfinished, since it&rsquo;s messy tinkering in progress, not least due to my #Vietnam routing. 👇</p>\n<p>Following <a href=\"https://www.easst.net/article/the-environmental-footprint-of-social-media-hosting-tinkering-with-mastodon/\">our Mastodon article</a>, I am exploring options to host a Fediverse instance with a Raspberry Pi and solar power, testing limits. The goal is to host one or multiple bots and report on data. Users later. Perhaps this could also be an offer for others to host bots. On another level, this is an effort to compare different fediverse setups and their Ease of use, efficiency, and waste. Other users have already created helpful reports that I can built on, see e.g. <a href=\"https://it-notes.dragas.net/2023/01/15/deploying-a-piece-of-the-fediverse/\">Deploying a piece of the Fediverse (dragas.net)</a></p>\n<p>It boils down to choosing the software. As a start, I have asked people on Mastodon and Lemmy for tips on what software to use.</p>\n<h1 id=\"moving-beyond-mastodon-the-heavy-elephant\">Moving beyond Mastodon: The heavy elephant</h1>\n<p>Users reported Mastodon is resource-heavy, and media caching is an issue, because it caches all media by default without any options to delete. It is not a light system; quite the contrary. Admins, it seems, need experience to manage the potential overload, regardless of their instance&rsquo;s size. At the same time, it lacks features like rich Markdown and Quote Tweets. Install seems to work, but many users report it took multiple hours.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I never used Mastodon because my servers would never handle it. I started with Friendica, moved to pleroma, and ended up ultimately with rebased (and obviously lemmy and lotide and peertube)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As a follow-up, that user reported:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My first server had an outdated CPU, very little memory and a spinning hard drive, so that turned out to be a huge limitation for a lot of software. I needed stuff that hardly used any memory and also didn&rsquo;t have a lot of extra services running at once.

				"content_text": "Here's a blog post on #hosting a microblogging instance on the #Fediverse with ecological concerns in mind. It's a longer one. And unfinished, since it's messy tinkering in progress, not least due to my #Vietnam routing. 👇\r\n\r\nFollowing [our Mastodon article](https://www.easst.net/article/the-environmental-footprint-of-social-media-hosting-tinkering-with-mastodon/), I am exploring options to host a Fediverse instance with a Raspberry Pi and solar power, testing limits. The goal is to host one or multiple bots and report on data. Users later. Perhaps this could also be an offer for others to host bots. On another level, this is an effort to compare different fediverse setups and their Ease of use, efficiency, and waste. Other users have already created helpful reports that I can built on, see e.g. [Deploying a piece of the Fediverse (dragas.net)](https://it-notes.dragas.net/2023/01/15/deploying-a-piece-of-the-fediverse/)\r\n\r\nIt boils down to choosing the software. As a start, I have asked people on Mastodon and Lemmy for tips on what software to use. \r\n\r\n# Moving beyond Mastodon: The heavy elephant\r\nUsers reported Mastodon is resource-heavy, and media caching is an issue, because it caches all media by default without any options to delete. It is not a light system; quite the contrary. Admins, it seems, need experience to manage the potential overload, regardless of their instance's size. At the same time, it lacks features like rich Markdown and Quote Tweets. Install seems to work, but many users report it took multiple hours.\r\n\r\n> I never used Mastodon because my servers would never handle it. I started with Friendica, moved to pleroma, and ended up ultimately with rebased (and obviously lemmy and lotide and peertube)\r\n\r\nAs a follow-up, that user reported:\r\n> My first server had an outdated CPU, very little memory and a spinning hard drive, so that turned out to be a huge limitation for a lot of software. I needed stuff that hardly used any memory and also didn't have a lot of extra services running at once. When I started adding some services, lots of stuff started grinding to a halt.\r\n\r\n> On linux, the glances application is really useful. Besides just showing you what programs are using memory and CPU time, it also shows IOWait times and throughput so if you're being bottlenecked by something or other it's a lot easier to see.\r\n\r\n> There's also a service called tuned that does some automatic tuning, and if you're using postgres databases, there's another tool called pg_repack that'll pack your database while running. It maxes out your CPU and uses a lot of disk while running, but if you don't do something routinely then your postgresql database slowly gets sloppier and it'll start using more and more resources until your server appears to be useless.\r\n\r\nMisskey or Calckey (now: FireFish) are slightly lighter options and much feature richer, but too heavy for a single instance. This is more of a personal project.\r\n\r\nThree options appear appropriate. Two of them were suggested in my original online post:\r\n\r\n# Original post on Mastodon and Lemmy asking for help\r\n> I'm looking for a customisable, resource-efficient Mastodon fork. Bonfire? Rebased? Or go non-Ruby, like Pleroma (nah), Misskey Calckey, indeed, Lemmy (hui)? Any experiences?\r\n\r\nThis is part of an endeavour to host w/ a RaspberryPi & solar power. It will be a device to mess around, test, and share experiences.\r\n\r\nPotential features:\r\n\r\n- tweaking network traffic in various ways\r\n- media options: off, auto compression, auto delete\r\n- monitoring server metrics, energy flow, sharing data through a bot\r\n- auto-off when battery low, sad emoji\r\n\r\nI am re-posting this from Mastodon w/ minor edits because of the Fediverse and potential cross-interaction. I probably should have posted here first and then shared the link on Mastodon, but it's a Mastodon question, so I did it the other way around. Still not sure what's the best way to do this, though.\r\n\r\n# Preface: static IP on the Pi\r\nThe Pi needs a static IP. Since the machine will be close to the solar battery system, I need a wifi option, as described here:\r\n[Set up a static IP-address | The Raspberry Pi Guide (raspberrypi-guide.github.io)](https://raspberrypi-guide.github.io/networking/set-up-static-ip-address)\r\n\r\nAnd, to make it open to the web: \r\nOpen up your router's admin page and find a section titled either **Port Forwarding**, **Port Mapping**, or **Port Management**, then create two new entries.\r\n\r\nThe first is for **HTTP** (insecure) traffic. Set both the local and public port to **80**, and the local IP address to the IP address of your Raspberry Pi.\r\n\r\nThe second is for **HTTPS** (secure) traffic. Set both the local and public port to **443**, while keeping the local IP address to the IP address of your Raspberry Pi.\r\n# Potential platforms\r\n## GoToSocial\r\n> it's still in alpha, but if it's just for messing around maybe try [GoToSocial](https://gotosocial.org/)!\r\n\r\n>I think you'd have a much better time with something lighter than Mastodon if it's running on a limited system.

Two recent articles in Science &amp; Technology Studies address this question with a view to different cases: Conference Mobility on the one hand and Decentralized Social Media on the other.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jumping-on-the-bandwagon\">Jumping on the bandwagon</h2>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.easst.net/article/fieldnotes-on-flyingless-conferencing/\"><em>Fieldnotes on FlyingLess Conferencing</em></a> we discuss our different experiences as train travelers to the EASST conference in Madrid. Some of them were long journeys through Europe, including stops. But it is possible, in Europe the plane is not without alternative, even if the scattered infrastructure does not always make it easy.</p>\n<p>A quote from our text (that is, by <a href=\"https://www.easst.net/article/fieldnotes-on-flyingless-conferencing/#authors\">Vanessa Ashall, Tobias Held, Stefan Laser, Julie Sascia Mewes, Mace Ojala, Nona Schulte-Roemer, Robert Smith, Richard Tutton, Sine Zambach</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Initiatives such as <a href=\"https://sites.tufts.edu/flyingless/\">Flying Less</a> and podcasts by the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/oxford_policy\">Oxford University Flyingless Group</a> provide information, discussion and practical suggestions on how we as individual academics can alter our practices, but also how to challenge our institutions and professional associations. There are also discussions on how to organise conferences in hybrid or hub-like formats to reduce travel activities. For the recently held EASST 2022 conference in July, some delegates decided to journey by long-distance train across Europe to reach Madrid. As one would expect from a group of STS scholars, this was not done without some appreciation of the sociotechnical challenges involved and of course with that long standing commitment of our field that ‘things could be otherwise’.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"shooting-down-the-bird\">Shooting down the bird</h2>\n<p>Digital communication has become a cornerstone of academic exchange, internally and with media and partners. In the fall and winter of 2022, Twitter and Elon Musk respectively have attracted some attention. The &ldquo;Birdsite&rdquo; is no longer the same; now it has become a right-wing agitation platform, with dubious blue-flagged accounts hijacking the discourse.

				"content_text": "---\nHow can social science research address planetary concerns and be designed carefully? Two recent articles in Science & Technology Studies address this question with a view to different cases: Conference Mobility on the one hand and Decentralized Social Media on the other.\n\n## Jumping on the bandwagon\n\nIn [*Fieldnotes on FlyingLess Conferencing*](https://www.easst.net/article/fieldnotes-on-flyingless-conferencing/) we discuss our different experiences as train travelers to the EASST conference in Madrid. Some of them were long journeys through Europe, including stops. But it is possible, in Europe the plane is not without alternative, even if the scattered infrastructure does not always make it easy. \n\nA quote from our text (that is, by [Vanessa Ashall, Tobias Held, Stefan Laser, Julie Sascia Mewes, Mace Ojala, Nona Schulte-Roemer, Robert Smith, Richard Tutton, Sine Zambach](https://www.easst.net/article/fieldnotes-on-flyingless-conferencing/#authors)):\n\n> Initiatives such as [Flying Less](https://sites.tufts.edu/flyingless/) and podcasts by the [Oxford University Flyingless Group](https://twitter.com/oxford_policy) provide information, discussion and practical suggestions on how we as individual academics can alter our practices, but also how to challenge our institutions and professional associations. There are also discussions on how to organise conferences in hybrid or hub-like formats to reduce travel activities. For the recently held EASST 2022 conference in July, some delegates decided to journey by long-distance train across Europe to reach Madrid. As one would expect from a group of STS scholars, this was not done without some appreciation of the sociotechnical challenges involved and of course with that long standing commitment of our field that ‘things could be otherwise’.\n\n## Shooting down the bird\nDigital communication has become a cornerstone of academic exchange, internally and with media and partners. In the fall and winter of 2022, Twitter and Elon Musk respectively have attracted some attention. The \"Birdsite\" is no longer the same; now it has become a right-wing agitation platform, with dubious blue-flagged accounts hijacking the discourse. But you can't do without social media, at least it makes sense to explore other forms of participation. With Fediverse, Mastodon, and other popular apps like PeerTube and Calckey, a veritable alternative is growing that is of utmost relevance to STS researchers.\n\nWe used the timing and discussions on Twitter and Mastodon to think about platform design and an \"Other.\"\n\nA quote from the post by [Stefan Laser, Anne Pasek, Estrid Sørensen, Mél Hogan, Mace Ojala, Jens Fehrenbacher, Maximilian Gregor Hepach, Leman Çelik, Koushik Ravi Kumar](https://www.easst.net/article/the-environmental-footprint-of-social-media-hosting-tinkering-with-mastodon/#authors):\n\n> What kinds of worlds are not probable but _possible_ from the ruins of Twitter?

It keeps popping up on the news. The mountain of waste is growing – more than 50 million tons per year, as the United Nations University estimates in its renowned “E-Waste” reports. And at the same time, consumers learn from the many reports about the strange routes that ‘their’ e-waste takes after disposal. These are usually stories in which things like old computers travel to the global south, to West Africa or Asia.</p>\n<p>What is being conveyed is a general uncertainty. Too little is happening. Garbage is not only not avoided, but it also makes conditions and life even worse. Individual consumption makes life in the distance worse. But this argument is misleading. Critical researcher points out that such reports reproduce racism and increase inequalities.</p>\n<p>High-tech at the end presents an alternative perspective. There is by no means little being done in dealing with electronic waste. The legal and industrial changes are just difficult to grasp.

It keeps popping up on the news. The mountain of waste is growing – more than 50 million tons per year, as the United Nations University estimates in its renowned “E-Waste” reports. And at the same time, consumers learn from the many reports about the strange routes that ‘their’ e-waste takes after disposal. These are usually stories in which things like old computers travel to the global south, to West Africa or Asia.\n\nWhat is being conveyed is a general uncertainty. Too little is happening. Garbage is not only not avoided, but it also makes conditions and life even worse. Individual consumption makes life in the distance worse. But this argument is misleading. Critical researcher points out that such reports reproduce racism and increase inequalities.\n\nHigh-tech at the end presents an alternative perspective. There is by no means little being done in dealing with electronic waste. The legal and industrial changes are just difficult to grasp. They take place on an infrastructural level that requires special attention. At the same time, the book’s core argument is that this is why the focus on individual responsibility – on households, for example – falls far short. It is industrial practices that are responsible for most waste and the most toxic waste; consumers cannot control this and do not even know about many industrial routines. “Infrastructures,” the book argues, “related production systems and their path dependencies are mainly responsible for material output, i.e. energy consumption, residues and waste. The ratios are difficult to estimate, but only between 3 and 9 per cent of e-waste is household waste, and even this waste is highly mediated. The exact calculation of this is not of central importance here, this is a controversy in itself, as the academic blog “Discard Studies” shows in detail.\n\nHigh-tech in the end develops the argument that an infrastructure of high-tech recycling has been established over the last three decades. You have to look at this infrastructure if you want to understand how waste is handled. By examining the everyday work on and with the high-tech infrastructure, taking into account its history, one gains a new view of social structures and dynamics.\n\n## Towards a new e-waste policy\n\nHigh-tech at the end discusses a variety of approaches to address the issues, including a critical look at the current European recycling industry. It should be viewed critically because it discusses waste in a rather one-sided way, usually in a negative way, i.e. as a hazard. Repair in particular offers potential here, while it is not held in very high esteem, especially when compared with the significant funding initiatives that shredder and smelting companies receive.\n\nIn the fourth part of the book, political questions are played through, and the focus is on political consequences and new democratic impulses.
